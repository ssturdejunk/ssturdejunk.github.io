                We guarantee complete work on any bike you buy from The Mountain Spoke. We even guarantee our work on bikes we don't sell as long as they were originally purchased from an Independent Bicycle Dealer. Our guarantee means you only pay for our service once. If you're not satisfied, we will continue to diagnose and service your bike for FREE (up to 30 days after the original service), until it's right as long as the problem is specifically related to our service. </aside>
